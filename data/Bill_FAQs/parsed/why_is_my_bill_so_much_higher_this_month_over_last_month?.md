Why is my bill so much higher this month over last month?
If this month is May or November, you will notice a difference in your bill
from the previous month (April or October) because of the California Climate
Credit. This credit is applied twice a year, in April and October. Many
customers believe their lower bill is a result of the weather changing during
these months, and in part it is, but this credit can be up to $80 if you
receive both gas and electric service from PG&E and so significantly reduces
your bill. For more information on the [California Climate Credit, visit us
