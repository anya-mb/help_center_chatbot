Do I need to pay my bill if it is estimated?
Yes, you still need to pay your bill if it is estimated. The estimated bill is
designed to keep payments on schedule to avoid a future larger bill that
covers multiple months, which may be more difficult to pay and may lead to
service interruption. If the estimated amount is higher than your actual
usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a credit, and
it will go toward your next bill(s). If the amount estimated is lower than
your usage, any additional amount owed will appear on your adjusted statement.

If you are unable to pay your estimated bill, you have options.

You can check and see if you are eligible for a payment arrangement or
extension. This can be done online by signing into [Your
Account](http://www.pge.com). If you don't have an online account, you can
create one. You can also make a partial payment of the balance until you
receive the adjusted bill.
