Will my credit be affected if my PG&E service is shut off?
No, as long as you do not cancel your account, your credit will not be
affected by a shut off. Active accounts are not referred to a collection
agency. As long as your residential account remains active, any late payments
will not be referred to a collection agency. However, a reconnection fee and
deposit may be required to restore services.
