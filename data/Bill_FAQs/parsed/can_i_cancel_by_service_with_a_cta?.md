Can I cancel by service with a CTA?
If you wish to cancel service with a Core Transport Agent (CTA) and resume
bundled services with PG&E, you will need to first contact the CTA to
terminate services with them. PG&E is unable to cancel a contract or guarantee
that the CTA will cancel. Check your bill for the correct contact information
for your CTA. Once the CTA cancels your contract, you will automatically come
back to PG&E as a bundled customer, no further action is required.

If you have reached out to your CTA and are unsatisfied with the CTA's
resolution:

  * Contact the Consumer Affairs Branch of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC):  **1-800-649-7570**
  * **or** Log a complaint online with the CPUC at: <http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/complaints/>

questions.
