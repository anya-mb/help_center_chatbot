How do I file a claim with PG&E?
If you believe PG&E should pay for a loss you have experienced, PG&E provides
two paths for compensation:

If you are a residential customer who has gone without power for at least 48
hours because of severe storm conditions, you may qualify for an automatic
payment under our Safety Net program. This program provides a payment of $25 -
$100, which we pay automatically approximately 60 days after the storm outage.
Do not file a claim for these payments: PG&E will calculate them
automatically.
