I share an apartment, how can I make my roommate pay?
We want to help you and your roommate(s) manage your PG&E account. We
recommend each roommateâ€™s name be added to the account to be financially
responsible, so that everyone is obligated to pay the bill on time and is
aware of any balance owed and the amount of energy used.

If you'd like to add your roommate(s) to your account, please call our
Customer Service Department at **1-800-743-5000.** Monday-Friday, 7 a.m. - 7
p.m. or Saturday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. Both parties need to be on the phone call to
complete this transaction.

Two or more adults who occupy the same premises are jointly liable for all
bills for energy supplied, per Applications Section B of Rule 3 of our
**[Electric
Tariffs](https://www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_RULES_3.pdf).**

account/specialized-customer-resources.html) for more tips and information.
