Why does the California Climate credit show up as a previous unpaid balance on my bill?
The California Climate Credit may appear as an unpaid balance on your account
in the days between when the credit is applied and when your April or October
bill is generated.

No action is necessary, and you should see resolution when you receive your
April or October statement.

and-assistance/understand-your-bill/california-climate-credit.html) page for
more information.
