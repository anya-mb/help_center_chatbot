Why are you estimating my bill?
PG&E can estimate bills for various reasons:

  * The meter could not be communicating
  * There could be access issues preventing us from reading the meter
  * You may have an analog meter read every other month

If your bill is estimated, keep payments on schedule to avoid a future large
bill covering several months. If the estimated amount is higher than your
actual usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a
credit, and it will go toward your next bill(s). If the amount estimated is
lower than your usage, any additional amount owed will appear on your adjusted
statement.
