Why does my collections notice only show my PG&E charges, and not the charges from my CCA?
PG&E can only disconnect for PG&E past due charges.

The 48-hour collection notice will have a line item for PG&E Delivery Charges
that are Past Due (red box). To avoid shut off, the amount in the red box will
need to be paid by the date indicated.

The minimum payment due to avoid disconnection is the amount in the red box,
however, you still owe your service provider for their portion of the total
balance.

Your TOTAL past due amount is the PG&E Delivery Charges Past Due plus the
Service Provider Charges Past Due.

Visit our **[Pay your PG&E Statement](https://www.pge.com/en/account/billing-
and-assistance.html?WT.mc_id=Vanity_waystopay)** page for ways to pay your
bill and avoid shut off.
