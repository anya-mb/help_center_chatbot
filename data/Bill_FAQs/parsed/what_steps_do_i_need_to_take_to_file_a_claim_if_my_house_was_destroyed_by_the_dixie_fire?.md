What steps do I need to take to file a claim if my house was destroyed by the Dixie Fire?
For homes destroyed by the Dixie fire, ‌PG&E’s Direct Payments for Community
Recovery (DP4CR) Program is designed to easily and quickly compensate
individuals whose homes, including mobile homes, and rental homes, were
destroyed by wildfire. Steps to submit a claim and the required documentation
can be found on the [Direct Payments for Community
Recovery](https://www.dp4cr.com/) webpage
([www.DP4CR.com](http://www.DP4CR.com)).

Individuals whose homes were destroyed by the fire may begin submitting claims
at the program website beginning on May 2, 2022.

Summary of the Process:

  1. Prepare to make your claim: check your eligibility, identify your co-claimants (or all members of your household), and gather documentation such as proof of identity and square footage of your home.
  2. Submit an electronic claim form with supporting documentation via this website.
  3. We review your claim to confirm your eligibility and identity; the details of your property including square footage and acreage; and your insurance coverage. We use this information to make you a settlement offer based on a standardized and objective valuation framework.
  4. Once you accept the offer and all co-claimants sign a settlement agreement releasing all of your claims related to the fire, we quickly pay you the full amount of our offer.
