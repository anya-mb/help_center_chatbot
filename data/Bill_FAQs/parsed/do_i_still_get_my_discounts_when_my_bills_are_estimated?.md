Do I still get my discounts when my bills are estimated?
If you are part of any discount programs such as CARE, FERA, or Medical
Baseline, you will still get your discount applied to the estimated bill. If
an adjustment is required to your billing when the estimated bills are
corrected, any discounts you receive will also be corrected.
