Why did I get a letter informing me I was under or over billed?
On a rare occasion, some customers experience what is referred to as a crossed
meter. This means that our billing system had two meters switched and billing
was being sent to the wrong person. Because no two households have identical
usage, this will result in a customer being over or under billed. The letter
you received will indicate if you have been over or under billed.

If you have been over billed, you will see a credit applied to your next
billing cycle. These credits can go back as far as three years if the issue
was in place for that long. In the case you were underbilled, you will receive
an adjusted bill that is higher than you would typically expect. As a consumer
protection, we will only back date billing three months.

If you receive a corrected bill and you are not able to pay it in one month,
you are able to set up a payment arrangement to spread out the balance. For
guidance on setting up a [payment arrangement online, follow our
guide](https://pgesupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12559719187085) in the
Help Center. You can also call **1-800-743-5000** and set up an arrangement
with the IVR.
