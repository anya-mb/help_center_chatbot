I am a sub-metered tenant and I think my landlord is not billing me correctly. Who do I call?
If you are a sub-metered customer (master-meter) and you have a complaint or
question on how your property owner or manager is billing you, we recommend
you first work with your property owner/manager to resolve your questions
and/or concerns.

If you are still unsatisfied after speaking to your property owner or manager,
please visit the [**California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Consumer
Affairs Branch**](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/about-cpuc/divisions/news-and-
public-information-office/consumer-affairs-branch) page.
