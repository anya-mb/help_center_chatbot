addition to these higher prices, lower temperatures have caused California to

An average PG&E gas and electric customer can expect to see an increase of
about 18% this winter over last.

Your gas bill will fluctuate depending on natural gas prices and increase
energy use, but may also change due to the season, a change in lifestyle or
the addition of family members.

Some commonly used appliances that consume natural gas are:

  * Clothes Dryers
  * Water Heaters
  * Furnace (heating)

These appliances usually do not consume an abundance of gas usage throughout
the summer months, but usage typically increases during winter or cooler
months and may cause an increase in your bill.
