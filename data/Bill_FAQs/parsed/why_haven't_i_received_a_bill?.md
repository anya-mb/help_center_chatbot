Why haven't I received a bill?
Although we continuously send more than 99 percent of bills out on time,
delays can occur due to a technical issue or an update to certain systems. In
these cases, your bill will be delayed. When this happens, PG&E works to
identify the cause of the delay, resolve the problem, and then send out your
bill.

**NOTE:** If you have not received your paper bill at a time you normally
receive it, you may be enrolled in our paperless billing option. To view your
bill, log into [Your Account](https://www.pge.com/) and select the View
Current Bill link.

If your bill is not available online and you have not received it in the mail,
you do not need to take any action at this time and we will not interrupt your
service while we address the cause of the delay.

financial assistance.
