What is an estimated bill?
An estimated bill is a bill that PG&E has created based on estimated usage and
not your actual usage. The bill can be estimated for various reasons, for
example:

  * Your meter could not be communicating
  * There could be access issues preventing us from reading the meter 
  * You may have an analog meter read every other month

PG&E uses the following information to provide the most accurate estimate for
your bill:

  * Your usage from the same time period within the last 12 months and/or available historical meter readings for the address
  * If you are part of any discount programs such as CARE, FERA, or Medical Baseline you will still get your discount applied to the estimated bill  

If your bill is estimated, keep payments on schedule to avoid a future large
bill covering several months. If the estimated amount is higher than your
actual usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a
credit, and it will go toward your next bill(s). If the amount estimated is
lower than your usage, any additional amount owed will appear on your adjusted
statement.

If you are unable to pay your estimated bill, you have options:

  * You can check to see if you are eligible for a payment arrangement or extension. This can be done online by signing into [Your Account](http://www.pge.com). If you don't have an online account, you can create one
  * You can also make a partial payment of the balance until you receive the adjusted bill
