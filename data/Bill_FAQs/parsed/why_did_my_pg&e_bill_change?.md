Why did my PG&E bill change?
Energy bills can go up or down for a variety of reasons beyond your control
like the weather, state regulations and commodity prices.

You can rest assured that **we do not** :

  * **Control the market prices** for gas and electricity.
  * **Mark up the cost of the gas and electricity** that we purchase on behalf of our customers.
  * **Make more money when our customers use more gas or electricity.** [This is called decoupling](https://www.pge.com/en_US/residential/rate-plans/how-rates-work/learn-how-rates-are-set/how-pge-makes-money/how-pge-makes-money.page).
  * **Encourage customers to use more energy.** Our profits do not come from the energy we sell.

  

**We make a profit on:**

  * The cost of building infrastructure (like powerlines) that delivers energy
  * How efficiently we run our business
  * Lowering our customers' energy use

**There are a few things you can control that may affect your bill, such as:**

  * The amount of energy you use
  * When you choose to use energy
  * Your rate plan
  * Enrolling in bill discount programs that you are eligible for

  

## Rate changes

  

Our gas and electric rates can change several times each year and are expected
to increase overall in 2023.  
All changes in rates need to be approved by the [California Public Utilities
CommissionOpens in new Window.](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/) (CPUC). The CPUC
regulates utilities like PG&E.  
These changes include:

  * Increases in the cost of purchasing gas and electricity
  * Maintaining our pipes and wires

  

**The money from these rate increases allows us to support critical
investments and programs that:**

  * Make the electric grid and gas system safer and more reliable
  * Reduce wildfire risk
  * Enable energy efficiency and renewable energy
  * Provide eligible, low-income customers with discounted energy bills

  

## Annual gas and electric rate change

  

Customer gas and electric rates changed on January 1, 2023, as part of an
annual process called the “true-up” authorized by the California Public
Utilities Commission.  
These rate changes include charges for:

  * Gas and electric delivery
  * Electricity supply
  * State-mandated assistance programs for income-qualified customers, energy efficiency and public-interest research and development.

  

As part of this year’s true-up, average residential non-CARE gas bills
decreased by 4.6 percent. This does not include natural gas supply costs.  
Average residential non-CARE electric (non-Community Choice Aggregator or
Direct Access) bills increased by approximately 3.4 percent.
