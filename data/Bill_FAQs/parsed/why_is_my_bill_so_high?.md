Why is my bill so high?
Many factors can lead to a higher than anticipated bill. Most commonly, high
usage, missed payments, and lost discounts contribute to high bills. Less
common causes include bill cycle length, delayed bills, and seasonal
crossover. PG&E offers a bill analyzer bot that will analyze your account for
the most common causes of high bills. You will need to authenticate your
account with your cell phone number and house number. [Visit us today for an
