What does PG&E do to reach out to customers before disconnecting (shutting off) service?
We understand these are difficult financial times, and we urge our customers
to call us or use our online programs as soon as they know they will have
trouble paying their bill. Disconnection of service is an action that PG&E
does not take lightly. It is a last resort taken after more than a 60-day
process involving many attempts to work with customers to resolve their bills.

Customers are encouraged to enroll in assistance programs at any point in the
process below:
