What can I do if I can't pay my estimated bill?
If you are unable to pay your estimated bill, you have options.

PG&E offers several programs to help pay your energy bill:

  * **Payment Arrangements:** You can break up your balance into manageable payments in amounts and dates that fit your financial situation. Sign into [**Your Account**](https://m.pge.com/?WT.pgeac=Nav_yourAccountRes#login) and scroll down to Payment Options. Select Payment Arrangement and then Installments. Installments allow you to spread your current balance over several months for up to 12 installments. Choose the option that works best for you. You must have your name on the account to request a payment arrangement.
