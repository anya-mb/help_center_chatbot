Can I submit a claim for the Dixie Fire impacts to my property?
Yes, if your home has been destroyed by the Dixie Fire and you would like to
submit a claim, please visit our [Direct Payments for Community Recovery
](https://www.dp4cr.com/)website ([www.DP4CR.com](http://www.DP4CR.com)).
Beginning May 2, 2022, the program gives eligible claimants a settlement offer
based on a standardized and objective framework and is intended to expedite
payment to impacted individuals.

With an easy-to-use website, individuals who lost their home in the fire can
submit a claim form and supporting documents, and if they accept PG&E's
settlement offer receive an expedited payment. Our goal is to resolve claims
within 75 days from the time individuals submit a complete claim.
