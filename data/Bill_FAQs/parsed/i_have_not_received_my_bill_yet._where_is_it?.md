I have not received my bill yet. Where is it?
Bill delays can be a result of a variety of situations, including delays with
the postal service.

We recommend creating an online account so you can see your bills as soon as
they are ready to view. You can sign up for an online account by visiting our
[**Manage Your Account
Online**](https://m.pge.com/?WT.pgeac=Nav_yourAccountRes#login) page.

_Paperless Billing:_

If you have not received your paper bill at a time you normally receive it,
you may be enrolled in our paperless billing option.

To view your bill, log into [**Your
Account**](https://m.pge.com/?WT.pgeac=Nav_yourAccountRes&_ga=2.247308676.1426975518.1612984638-109012148.1612984638#login)
and select the View Current Bill link.

  * Click the Edit Profile & Alerts box in the top right. 
  * Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click on the alert that says Go Paperless. 
  * Here you can turn on or off the option for paperless billing.

Other reasons for a delayed bill statement could be due to a recent rate plan
change, solar system or battery storage system being approved, or a network
connection failure.

If your bill is not available online and you have not received it in the mail,
call our Customer Service Department at [**1-800-743-5000**]() and a Customer
Service Representative can research the likely reason for the delay.
