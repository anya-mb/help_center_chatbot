How can I monitor my bill during the month?
You can monitor your usage and projected bill amount by logging into [Your
Account](https://www.pge.com) and reviewing Energy Usage Details. Projected
bills are available after the first week of your billing cycle. Additionally,
you can set up Billing Alerts to receive notifications if your bill is
anticipated to be above a threshold of your choosing. Steps for each process
are shown below.

To view your projected bill:

  1. Sign into Your Account
