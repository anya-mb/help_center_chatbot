Why did I get another bill after I stopped service?
If you recently stopped service but got another bill, it is likely your final
bill. Final charges take approximately a week to process after the stop date
requested. The detail page of your bill will reflect the date you stopped
being charged for the usage. The bill due date will be three weeks after the
bill processing date.

**EXAMPLE:** Stop date requested 12/14/2022. Final bill processed 12/23/2022.
Bill due date 01/13/2022.
