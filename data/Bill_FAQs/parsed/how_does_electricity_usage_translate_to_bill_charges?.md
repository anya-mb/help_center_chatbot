How does electricity usage translate to bill charges?
The easiest way to understand the connection between usage and charges is to
view the fluctuation in a bar graph format.

You can see how your electricity usage translates to bill charges by logging
into [**Your Account**](https://m.pge.com/#login) and click on Energy Usage
Details.

In the Energy Usage Details, click on Energy Costs. Hover over one of the blue
bars within the graph to see the energy use and cost for that designated time
period.

Change the bill view drop down in the center of the page to get a Year View
(month by month), Bill View or Day View. You can also change the graph to
display your usage and/or charges for electricity and natural gas usage
separately or combined the two.

The average temperature in your area will appear on the graph relation to your
usage.
