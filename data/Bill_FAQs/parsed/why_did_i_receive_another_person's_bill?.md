Why did I receive another person's bill?
The most common reason customers receive another person's bill is that it is
the previous resident’s final bill. Not all customers provide PG&E with their
forwarding mailing address so we will send the invoice to that resident’s last
known address.

Like other postal mail situations, it could simply be a mistake in delivery
and may belong to a neighbor or someone with a similar service address.

In rare situations, some customers may not have completed their start of
service when they moved to a new address, and services for the new address may
still be in the previous resident’s name. If you want to confirm your service,
visit us [online ](http://www.pge.com) or call **1-800-743-5000.**  
  
Please do not open another customers bill.
