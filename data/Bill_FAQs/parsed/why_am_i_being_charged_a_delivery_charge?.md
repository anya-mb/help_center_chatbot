Why am I being charged a delivery charge?
The delivery portion of your electric and gas bill covers the cost of getting
the applicable services to you. For electric service, this includes the
building and maintaining power lines, meters, billing systems, etc. that get
the electricity from where it is generated to your home or business.
Similarly, for gas, this includes the building and maintenance of the
pipelines, meters, and billing systems used to get gas to your home. If you
see a separate line item on page one of your bill for delivery, it is likely
that you have a third party providing the generation of your electricity or
procurement of your gas. Although you always pay for delivery, when a third
party is present, these charges are separated out.
