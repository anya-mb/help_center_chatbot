How do you estimate my bill?
PG&E uses the following information to provide the most accurate estimate:

  * Based on your usage from the same time period within the last 12 months and/or available historical meter readings for the address
  * If you are part of any discount programs such as CARE, FERA, or Medical Baseline you will still get your discount applied to the estimated bill
  * Weather patterns and usage trends

If your bill is estimated, keep payments on schedule to avoid a future large
bill covering several months. If the estimated amount is higher than your
actual usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a
credit, and it will go toward your next bill(s). If the amount estimated is
lower than your usage, any additional amount owed will appear on your adjusted
statement.
