When will I receive my delayed bill?
Most bill delays are due to system updates, which may take some time. As a
result, we do not currently have an estimated date for when your bill will be
ready. Once those system updates are complete, we will send your bill to you.

We are committed to working with you to provide a reasonable time to pay your
balance. If you need help paying your bill, please visit [Find help to pay
your bill or save energy](https://www.pge.com/en/account/billing-and-
assistance/financial-assistance.html?WT.mc_id=Vanity_financialassistance) or
call us at **1-800-743-5000** to spread your payments over time or apply for
financial assistance.
