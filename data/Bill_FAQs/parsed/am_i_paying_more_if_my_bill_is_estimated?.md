Am I paying more if my bill is estimated?
If your billing is estimated, PG&E works hard to estimate your usage as
accurately as possible. PG&E uses a complex formula that includes your own
historical usage, rate information, and weather trends to bill as close to
accurate as possible. However, if your actual energy usage is higher than the
previous year, the billed amount (estimated bill) could be lower than if you
received a bill for your actual usage. Conversely, if your usage is lower than
it was the previous year, the billed amount (estimated bill) may be higher
than if you received a bill for your actual usage.  
  
If your bill is estimated, keep payments on schedule to avoid a future large
bill covering several months. If the estimated amount is higher than your
actual usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a
credit, and it will go toward your next bill(s). If the amount estimated is
lower than your usage, any additional amount owed will appear on your adjusted
statement.
