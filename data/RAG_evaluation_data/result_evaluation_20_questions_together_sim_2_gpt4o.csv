Final charges take approximately a week to process after the stop date\nrequested. The detail page of your bill will reflect the date you stopped\nbeing charged for the usage. The bill due date will be three weeks after the\nbill processing date.\n\n**EXAMPLE:** Stop date requested 12/14/2022.

This means that our billing system had two meters switched and billing\nwas being sent to the wrong person. Because no two households have identical\nusage, this will result in a customer being over or under billed. The letter\nyou received will indicate if you have been over or under billed.\n\nIf you have been over billed, you will see a credit applied to your next\nbilling cycle. These credits can go back as far as three years if the issue\nwas in place for that long. In the case you were underbilled, you will receive\nan adjusted bill that is higher than you would typically expect. As a consumer\nprotection, we will only back date billing three months.\n\nIf you receive a corrected bill and you are not able to pay it in one month,\nyou are able to set up a payment arrangement to spread out the balance.

You can also call **1-800-743-5000** and set up an arrangement\nwith the IVR.\n\n \n\n What is an estimated bill? \n An estimated bill is a bill that PG&E has created based on estimated usage and\nnot your actual usage. The bill can be estimated for various reasons, for\nexample:\n\n  * Your meter could not be communicating\n  * There could be access issues preventing us from reading the meter \n  * You may have an analog meter read every other month\n\nPG&E uses the following information to provide the most accurate estimate for\nyour bill:\n\n  * Your usage from the same time period within the last 12 months and/or available historical meter readings for the address\n  * If you are part of any discount programs such as CARE, FERA, or Medical Baseline you will still get your discount applied to the estimated bill  \n\nIf your bill is estimated, keep payments on schedule to avoid a future large\nbill covering several months. If the estimated amount is higher than your\nactual usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a\ncredit, and it will go toward your next bill(s).

This means that our billing system had two meters switched and billing\nwas being sent to the wrong person. Because no two households have identical\nusage, this will result in a customer being over or under billed. The letter\nyou received will indicate if you have been over or under billed.\n\nIf you have been over billed, you will see a credit applied to your next\nbilling cycle. These credits can go back as far as three years if the issue\nwas in place for that long. In the case you were underbilled, you will receive\nan adjusted bill that is higher than you would typically expect. As a consumer\nprotection, we will only back date billing three months.\n\nIf you receive a corrected bill and you are not able to pay it in one month,\nyou are able to set up a payment arrangement to spread out the balance. For\nguidance on setting up a [payment arrangement online, follow our\nguide](https://pgesupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12559719187085) in the\nHelp Center. You can also call **1-800-743-5000** and set up an arrangement\nwith the IVR.\n\n \n\n What is an estimated bill? \n An estimated bill is a bill that PG&E has created based on estimated usage and\nnot your actual usage. The bill can be estimated for various reasons, for\nexample:\n\n  * Your meter could not be communicating\n  * There could be access issues preventing us from reading the meter \n  * You may have an analog meter read every other month\n\nPG&E uses the following information to provide the most accurate estimate for\nyour bill:\n\n  * Your usage from the same time period within the last 12 months and/or available historical meter readings for the address\n  * If you are part of any discount programs such as CARE, FERA, or Medical Baseline you will still get your discount applied to the estimated bill  \n\nIf your bill is estimated, keep payments on schedule to avoid a future large\nbill covering several months. If the estimated amount is higher than your\nactual usage, you will receive an adjustment on the amount overpaid as a\ncredit, and it will go toward your next bill(s). If the amount estimated is\nlower than your usage, any additional amount owed will appear on your adjusted\nstatement.\n\nIf you are unable to pay your estimated bill, you have options:\n\n  * You can check to see if you are eligible for a payment arrangement or extension. This can be done online by signing into Your Account. If you don't have an online account, you can create one\n  * You can also make a partial payment of the balance until you receive the adjusted bill\n\n \n\n Why is my bill so high? \n Many factors can lead to a higher than anticipated bill. Most commonly, high\nusage, missed payments, and lost discounts contribute to high bills. Less\ncommon causes include bill cycle length, delayed bills, and seasonal\ncrossover. PG&E offers a bill analyzer bot that will analyze your account for\nthe most common causes of high bills. You will need to authenticate your\naccount with your cell phone number and house number.
